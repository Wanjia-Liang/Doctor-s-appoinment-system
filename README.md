**Now I want to set up a doctor's appointment system.
The software should permit 4 parties(patients, nurses, doctors, and managers) to access it and make operations.**

**Feature:**

**User-friendly interface:** The system should have a user-friendly interface to make it easy for patients, nurses, doctors, and managers to use.

**Data Security:** The system should implement robust data security measures to ensure the confidentiality and privacy of patient information.
Patient management:** Patients should be able to register, book appointments, view their appointment history, receive appointment reminders, and provide feedback.

**Doctor and nurse management:** Doctors and nurses should be able to view their schedules, manage their appointments, update patient records, and record notes during appointments.

**Appointment scheduling:** The system should allow for appointment scheduling, rescheduling, and cancellations, as well as setting availability for each doctor and nurse.

**Patient Health Records:** The system should allow for the creation, storage and updating of patient health records to ensure accuracy and availability of information.

**Reporting:** The system should generate reports on appointment bookings, patient attendance, and doctor availability to help managers make informed decisions.

**Billing and Payment:** The system should integrate with billing and payment systems to manage payment for appointments and treatment.

**Access Control:** The system should have user-level access controls to ensure that each party only has access to the information and functions relevant to their role.

**User story:**

**From a patient's perspective,**
As a patient, I want to be able to easily schedule and manage my doctor appointments, so that I can receive the medical care I need without having to navigate a complicated system.
I log into the doctor's appointment system using my computer or mobile device.
I chat with the robot to decide which department I should follow.
I click on the "Book Appointment" button and select my preferred doctor from a list of available providers.(when the situation is urgent, I check which doctor is available the most recently)
After filling out a questionnaire survey, I choose a date and time for my appointment that fits my schedule. 
The system confirms my appointment and sends me a confirmation email or SMS to remind me of the date and time.
A few days before my appointment, I receive a reminder via email or SMS to help me remember.
On the day of my appointment, I arrive at the clinic and check-in using the system.
After my appointment, I log back into the system to view my updated health records and any notes from the doctor.
I am able to easily manage my future appointments by logging back into the system at any time.

**From a doctor's perspective,**
As a doctor, I want to be able to schedule appointments with my patients through an online system that is easy to use and accessible from any device. The system should allow me to view my upcoming appointments, mark appointments as complete, take notes for patients and myself and reschedule appointments if necessary. Additionally, please provide me with the patients' questionnaire survey results before the appointment and remind me whether the patient is for the first time. If not, when was the last time?

**From a nurse's perspective,**
As a nurse, I want to have access to a reliable and user-friendly appointment system that allows me to efficiently schedule appointments for my patients and monitor their upcoming appointments. The system should provide me with real-time updates on the status of each appointment and allow me to reschedule appointments if necessary. Additionally, the system should allow me to view my patients' medical history, including their past appointments, test results, and medication information, to ensure that I have all the necessary information to provide high-quality care. By using this appointment system, I can save time and reduce the risk of errors, while also providing my patients with a better overall experience.

**From a manager's perspective,**
As a manager, I want to ensure that our patients have a seamless and efficient experience with our services and that our staff has a user-friendly interface. I organize my team to optimize the system's running by analyzing the overalls of various system-generated data, like monthly patient appointments and feedback.
